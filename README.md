["Multi-Set Testing Strategies Show Good Behavior When Applied to Very Large Sets of Rare Variants"](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2020.591606/full)
was published in Frontiers in Genetics in October 2020. This project built on the intuition of testing biologically informed pathways
(a common practice in gene expression analysis) and evaluated from a theoretical standpoint whether a similar approach for genetic data 
could improve the power of a test of association with a binary outcome. The paper provides power graphs of our simulation results as well
as the results of a real data analysis. 

This research was conducted as part of an undergraduate team under the direction of [Dr. Nathan Tintle](https://www.dordt.edu/academics/faculty-info/about-me/ntintle)
as part of the Statistical Genetics and Biostatistics summer research program at Dordt University in the 2018.
